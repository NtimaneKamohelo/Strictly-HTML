Odins Links and Images

-> Links are one of the key features of HTML. They allow us to link HTML pages.

1. How to create links to pages on other websites on the internet.

a. Anchor Elements
-We use an Anchor Element to create an HTML link.
Example: <a>Anchor Element</a>
- This is just an example of what an anchor element looks like. It is not a clear link it does nothing. 

- We need to specify the destination. use "href" in a ancho.
Example: <a href="https:www.theodinproject.com/about">Click me</a>

b. Absolute and Relative links
-> Two types of links:
+ Links to pages on the other websites on the internet.
+ links to pages located on our websites.

- Absolute Links: links to other websites on the internet.
Example: protocol: //domain/path
IRL:    https://www.theodinproject.com/about

- Relative Links: Links to other pages within our website.
+ Relative links do not have a link but a file path to other pages that are relative to the page you are creating the link on.
